1./Infinite Mario- I tried a lot of different checks, but jumping and running works best for level 0. After level 0, everything
gets extremely hectic.

2./ Sliding Puzzle- everythign should be working fine. Intitially, the code i wrote myself did nto work and had too many bugs.
Therefore, I used the code you posted on github as a framework.

3./ AStar- My Astar did not work at all. I asked Mike if I could look at his code and use it, and he was fine with it. 
It is 100% his work, but I did look through it carefully and udnerstands it and have an idea why my is not working. 

4./ Art Forging- I spent the most time on this assignment, and it works fine. You should be able to see the shapes after about
3000 generations, which takes about 30 seconds or so.

5./ Othello- I was on the team wiht Mike and Winston. Our bot was named Anastasia.

6./ LinearRegression- It works really well. 

7./ ANN- My ANN right now only works for one hidden layer right now, but it works very well. I will continue to work on it since it is
really itneresting. ANN.py has my attempt at makign multiple hidden layers work, but workingANN.py has the working code for one hidden layer.

8./ I think my cluster program is working well. It seems to be grouping similar movies together.
